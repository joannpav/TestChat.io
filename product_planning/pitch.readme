TestChat Pitch

Bridging the communication gap between developers, testers & production owners

the problem:
Agile teams are expected to self organize, but if a culture of quality is not engrained on the team, agile becomes mini waterfall. Test tasks get thrown over the wall to be tackled by SDETs after most of the design and development have been done. This is even a greater problem with Kanban as developers work through coding tasks then hand them off to QA and move on to the next task.

No one wants more meetings to review test scenarios. No one wants to be interrupted mid ‘coding flow’ to stop and look at test scenarios. But everyone wants to ensure that they are delivering solid, but free features. TC bridges this gab by allowing the team to review and offer feedback on test scenarios. Communication without wasting time.
